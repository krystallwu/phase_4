i. Instructions to setup your app
After downloading the files, run "npm run dev" in the frontend folder. (this is if you have Vite + React installed)
ii. Instructions to run your app
Once npm run dev is completed, terminal produces a local host link, and copy and paste the link into your browser. (e.g. http://localhost:5173/)
iii. Brief explanation of what technologies you used and how you accomplished your
application (donâ€™t spend too much time on this)
We used React + Vite for the frontend and Flask as backend for connecting the SQL database to the frontend. We used our SQL files from the previous phase. 
With experience working on webapps, our team dove into allocating tasks, so we met a few times in person. At the first meeting, we allocated responsibilities and made progress towards personal goals. 
Working in person was vital to accomplishing our webapp because it allowed teammates to communicate when they needed help. We met a few times after that to make progress together and different teammates stepped in and helped out when other teammates needed help which was really important.
iv. Explanation of how work was distributed among the team members
Alina and Vikram worked on connecting the database to our webapp. They used Flask and once a procedure or view was correctly connected, the rest were connected in a similar fashion. 
Krystal worked on the frontend portion, so she made separate JSX files for each procedure and then linked each JSX as a route for user to take to that procedure/view. She used CSS to style the page.
